⦁	in the comments, i found: "A couple of tracks were copyright to Nemrac in 1968, both by Karen Ann Livesay, and 1969, both by Stephen Gross. Noting that the author of the B side of this release was one Meade Livesay (see linked release for credit) I did some poking around and found a piece in the Indianapolis Star: 'She [Carmen Lesay] was graduated from Virginia Polytechnic Institute at the age of 18 and went to work for Hughes Aircraft Company in Culver City, Calif. There she met and married her husband, Meade Livesay, who is an executive for an aircraft company. They live in a suburb of Los Angeles and have a 14-year-old daughter, Karen, who already has decided to become a doctor, 'either a general practitioner or an obstetrician,' Karen says. Karen has also written the words and music to a song which she has recorded and which will be released soon.' Meade Livesay died in 2009: his obituary makes no mention of a musical or publishing career, but does mention that his first wife was 'Costa Rican born electrical engineer Carmen Venegas Livesay'. Maybe "Lesay" was derived from 'Livesay' as a stage name? I think we can tentatively assume that Nemrac was the Livesay family's firm."
