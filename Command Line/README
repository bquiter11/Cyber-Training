This module gave me the chance to strengthen my command-line skills across both Linux and Windows. The TryHackMe and Linux Journey rooms helped me build a solid foundation with navigation, file operations, and permissions, while the Windows exercises showed me how similar concepts apply in a different environment. Even with some prior experience, repeating the basics made me faster and more confident.

The OverTheWire Bandit challenges were the highlight for me. Each level forced me to think differently, and while I tried to solve them on my own, I also researched commands and concepts I wasnâ€™t fully comfortable with. I especially enjoyed discovering tools like tr for ROT13, and I was pushed hardest by the hexdump and compression level, but pushing through it felt rewarding.

Overall, the module reminded me why I love cybersecurity: you learn something new every day. I realized I need more practice memorizing what certain commands do (uniq, xxd, tr, etc.) and getting comfortable with compression tools, but this was a fun and valuable way to learn through problem-solving.
