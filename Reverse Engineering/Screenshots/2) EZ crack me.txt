1. Used chat to help me explore functions of Ghidra. Saw the layout and found w0rd ou Got This! rong! Some spaces/letters were missing, so I wanted to explore more.

2. Went to the Window function, clicked Defined Strings, found some strings, specifically one titled password. Didn't give me enough information so I kept digging. 

3. Went to the Search for Strings button and made it so I can find strings. Had to search up what boxes/options to check for the most optimal search. After searching, I found at the very bottom "P455w0rdYou Got This!\nWrong!\n"

4. This is the password!
