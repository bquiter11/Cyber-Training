1) Static analysis summary via Ghidra

opened the file in Ghidra. Decompiled core observed in main() 

Decompiled snippet:
  char input[0x70];
  scanf("%s", input);
  rax = strcmp(input, "your mum is very sexy");
  if (rax != 0) {
      puts("you win!");
      system("pause");
  } else {
      printf("you loose!");
  }
  return 0;

what i think it means:

-the password is in plain sight (your mum is very sexy)
-the program is inverted. no matter what i type i still get "you win!". 
-because the code is reversed (if (strcmp != 0) → win), i always get  “you win!”
-i can't get it to say "you loose!" no matter how many words i type because the input function itself prevents it.
